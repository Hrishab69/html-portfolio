<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a multidisciplinary designer and creative currently pursuing a BTech degree, with a strong foundation in graphic design and over three years of hands-on experience in UI/UX design. My journey in design started with a passion for visual storytelling, which naturally evolved into a focus on crafting intuitive, user-centered digital experiences. Whether it's wireframing user flows or refining pixel-perfect interfaces, I enjoy blending functionality with aesthetics to create designs that truly connect with people..</p>

<p>In addition to UI/UX, I have a solid background in illustration, backed by on-field experience that has sharpened my eye for detail and deepened my understanding of visual communication. From brand mascots to editorial pieces, I bring stories to life through line, color, and form. Illustration continues to be a big part of my creative identity and often complements my design work in unique ways.

  Recently, I’ve been expanding my skill set into web development, aiming to bridge the gap between design and development. I believe that understanding how things are built is just as important as designing them—and I’m excited to bring my designs to life through code. This new chapter allows me to craft more seamless and interactive experiences from start to finish.</p>

<p>With every project, I aim to create thoughtful, engaging, and accessible solutions—whether it’s a mobile app, a website, or a piece of illustrated art. I’m always curious, constantly learning, and driven by a desire to create work that’s both impactful and meaningful.</p>
